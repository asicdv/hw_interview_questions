# Count Ones (population count)

# Question

Given an input logic vector, compute the number of bits set (the population
count).

# Commentary

The population count function is very common in software, although
perhaps infrequent in logic design. Presented here is simply a
question that may be poised to gain an appreciation of a candidates
ability to write synthesizable Verilog and to understand the relative
trade-offs between different solutions.

Presented are three possible solutions to this problem.

## R0 - Gated Adders

For each bit in the vector, a M = LOG2(A) + 1 adder is infered. The
input to each adder is 'b1 gated upon the presence of a 1 in the
current bit position of A. This solution is relatively trivial however
scales poorly with N, M-bit adders infered.

## R1 - Look Up Table

Instead, bit counts can be pre-computed for certain vector
lengths. Although the approach remains similar to that of the prior
solution, the number of adders can be reduced by W, where W is the
width of the LUT.

In the presented solution, LUT functionality is implemented using a
combinatorial logic cone derived from A. It is not implemented as a
specific ROM macro as may have been implied.

## R2 - Carry Save Adder (CSA)

A Carry Save Adder (CSA) can be infered using 3:2 compressor
blocks. Such blocks are commonly optimized in most standard cell
libraries and are therefore area and performance efficient. The final
population counter is derived by infering a final full-adder using the
standard CSA approach. This solution, although the most area and
performance efficient, is slightly harder to code, and cannot be
easily parameterized for reuse.
