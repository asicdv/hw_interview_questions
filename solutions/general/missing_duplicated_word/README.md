# Problem

Given an array with 2n+1 integer elements, n elements appear twice in
arbitrary places in the array and a single integer appears only once
somewhere inside. Find the lonely integer with O(n) operations and
O(1) extra memory.

# Commentary

An even occurence of a variable can be detected by flipping a bit each
time it is sampled (zero occurences is considered even). For a SRAM
containing 2N+1 entries, of width W, odd occurances of a variable can
be detected by maintaining a 2^W vector, and flipping the
corresponding bit in the vector each time the value is read from
SRAM. After having queried the state table, provided the input is not
malformed, the non-duplicated value can be identified by encoding the
final 1 hot vector.

# Complexity

O(N) lookup operations are required. Lookup is linear with the number
of table entries. Recall that O(2N+1)=O(N), as one could mistakely
assume that the 2N+1 table can only be queried using N operations..

O(1) state is required (with respect to N).

O(2^W) state is required with respect to W.
