# Question

Derive code to detect the first 0 in an input vector and to invert it,
and all preceding bits. What function does the logic perform?

# Commentary

Code to compute this function is presented.

It turns out, non-obviously, that this function actually computes an
increment-by-1 function on the input vector. It remains up for debate
whether the advantage that such logic would have over the inference of
a traditional full-adder. Additionally, the complexity of the
resultant code obscures the fact that it computes a trivially and
well-known function. In this case, it would almost always be advisible
for the logic designer to write a simple increment function and all
synthesize to infer the most efficient structure at the gate-level.
