# Problem Statement

A constant, sparse integer is to be multiplied against an arbitrary
random vector. Derive efficient logic to perform this
operation. (Sparse means that the vector has only a small number of
bits set).

# Commentary

Multiplication is simply the repeated addition of the multiplicand
over differing shifts. For a sparse constant, multiplication can be
carried out efficiently by infering N adders (where N is the
population count of the constant) adding the i'th shifted version of
the input (where 'i' is the location of the bit in the constant
vector).

Addition can be efficiently performed by using a CSA structure. Which
should be efficiently infered by repeated addition operators.
