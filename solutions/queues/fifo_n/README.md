# Problem Statement

From a dual-ported synchronous SRAM macro, carve N-statically sized
FIFO/Queue data structures. Each data structure must support
simultaneous push/pop operation, as in a tradition queue.

# Commentary

The N-Context (Virtual-Queue) problem is a logical extension of the
traditional FIFO design which the additional qualification that the
address into the RAM are prepended by the Context ID.
