# Problem Statement

Design an FSM which vends a single $0.40 item and only accepts nickels and
dimes. This input signals are nickel and dime and the outputs are vend and
change. The two input signals are pulsed high when a nickel or a dime is
inserted into the machine. When enough money has been added, the vend signal
goes high for a single cycle. If $0.45 had been inserted, change also pulses
high for one cycle. After vending an item, the state returns to the initial
state where no money has been inserted.
